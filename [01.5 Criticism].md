This is a story about finding oneself, but it's drowning in the "tell, don't show" swamp.  You've got all the ingredients for a compelling narrative, but you're serving them up as a bland, descriptive soup instead of a flavorful, character-driven dish. 

Here's a breakdown of the issues, with a focus on how to fix them:

**1.  The Narrator's Voice:**

* **Overly Descriptive:**  Your writing is bogged down by too much telling.  Instead of showing us Steven's emotional state, you're narrating it.  "He was tired," "His passion had waned," "He felt suffocated," "He was filled with a sense of longing."  These are all statements, not actions or sensory details.
* **Passive Voice:**  The overuse of passive voice makes the narrative feel flat and unengaging.  For example, "His dreams were suffocated."  This could be rewritten as "The city suffocated his dreams" to bring more agency to the story.
* **Clichéd Language:**  Phrases like "city that never sleeps," "relentless chase," "suffocating weight" are overused and lack originality.

**Solution:**  Show us Steven's emotions through his actions, his dialogue, his internal monologue.  Instead of "He was tired," show us his slumped posture, the way he avoids eye contact, or the way he drags his feet as he walks.  

**2.  Character Development:**

* **Surface-Level Characters:**  Your characters feel more like archetypes than real people. We don't get a sense of their unique voices, quirks, or motivations.  They're defined by their aspirations and their relationships, but not by their personalities.  
* **One-Dimensional Relationships:**  Sarah is defined solely as "ambitious" and "relentless," which makes her feel like a caricature.  Leo is the "cynical filmmaker," and Ethan is the "successful photographer."  They lack depth and complexity. 

**Solution:**  Give your characters more agency. Let them drive the story through their actions, their thoughts, and their unique voices.  Show us their flaws, their desires, their struggles.  

**3.  Dialogue:**

* **Lack of Authenticity:** The dialogue feels forced and unnatural.  It's mostly used to convey information or to reiterate the character's inner thoughts.
* **Overly Expository:** The dialogue often tells us what we already know.  For example, "You should come visit, Steve," Ethan said. "It's a different world here. You need a change of scenery."  This is redundant and doesn't give us any insight into the characters.

**Solution:**  Write dialogue that reveals character and moves the plot forward.  Let your characters surprise each other, disagree with each other, challenge each other. 

**4.  Storytelling:**

* **Lack of Conflict:** The story is driven by Steven's internal conflict, but it lacks external conflict to create tension and drive the plot forward. 
* **Overly Linear:** The story progresses in a predictable, linear fashion. There are no real twists or surprises.

**Solution:**  Introduce obstacles that Steven must overcome.  Maybe he encounters a roadblock on his journey, or maybe he has a conflict with a new friend.  Maybe he has to face his past by running into Sarah.  Create stakes and tension that force him to make difficult choices.

**5.  Specificity:**

* **Vague Descriptions:**  The language is too general and lacks vivid detail.  Instead of saying "He felt a sense of awe," describe the way the mountain peaks pierce the sky, the way the wind whispers through the trees, the way the air tastes crisp and clean.

**Solution:**  Use sensory details to immerse the reader in the story.  Show us the sights, sounds, smells, textures, and tastes of Steven's world.

**Here's a concrete example of how to rewrite a scene using "show don't tell":**

**Original:**

> He was tired. Tired of the relentless city, the constant struggle, the endless parade of faces all chasing the same fleeting dream. His own acting aspirations, once a burning ember, had dwindled to a faint flicker.

**Rewrite:**

> The fluorescent lights of the bodega buzzed, casting a harsh glare on the crumpled audition script in his hand. Steven traced the faded ink with his thumb, the paper rough beneath his touch. He hadn't slept well, his mind replaying the casting director's words: "You lack conviction."  He felt the familiar ache in his chest, the dull throb of a dream slowly dying. The city outside, usually a symphony of energy, felt like a cacophony of noise, a constant reminder of his failures.  

**Instead of telling us about his tiredness, we see it in his actions, his thoughts, and the environment around him.  The scene is richer and more evocative.**

**Remember, your goal is to immerse the reader in Steven's journey.  Make them feel his frustration, his hope, his fear.  Use the tools of storytelling—vivid description, compelling dialogue, engaging plot—to create a truly captivating story.**
